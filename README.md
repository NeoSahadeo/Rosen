**Introduction**
Rosen is a Reddit clone. It's a project I've undertaken to learn about the ins-and-outs of API development and front-end development.

It definitely might not be the most optimised, conventional, and proper way to do things but I see it as getting a foot in the door.

The name "Rosen" came from the [Einstein-Rosen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole) bridge (A.K.A a wormhole). I was messing about in [LibreSprite](https://libresprite.github.io/#!/) and drew a blackhole pixart. A few days later I had the brilliant idea to start this project and thought this would be an amazing brand image.

## Techstack

- Front-end: Svelte
- Backend: Django & Django Rest, Sveltekit

**Why Svelte?**
I thought Svelte looked very interesting. I've been using React this and that with a healthy does of Nextjs. Trying something new never hurt.

**Why Django / Django REST api?**
During the Harvard CS50W course I used Django's Web Framework for the entirety of the front-end and back-end. And it's great, but I needed to try something new. What better place than the garden shed with *Django REST framework*.

**SvelteKit?**
Sveltekit is the recommended way to build Svelte components (I think I read it somewhere). It was fun either way.
